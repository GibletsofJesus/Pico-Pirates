# Pico-Pirates

============
 To-do list
============

+ Incorporate combat mechanics from boat_combat.p8
	- Add chance encounters to cell probabilities
	- Random circular waves for octopus encounter
	- Think about how to add combat between other ships
+ Morale mechanics
	- Slowly decrease over time
	- On combat complete, increase
	- Tie morale into speed, but not 1:1
	- On low morale, crew try to mutiny, complete mini-game to keep playing, stay in control
+ Things on islands
	- Rum cache, morale+
	- Message in bottle, points to treasure on another island
	- Lost pirate, recruitment?
+ Lighthouse
	- Either remove entirely or give it some sort of purpose
+ How to play section
	- Put during transition after splash?
+ Digging for treasure
	- Every island has a probability of finding loot
	- Finding a message in a bottle or otherwise finding out where treasure might be increases probability of finding treasure from say 1/20 to 15/20
	- Tie into morale mechanics
